# T3 Project Manager

## Functionality

Users can create an account to gain access to their project manager dashboard -

They should be able to create a new workspace -

They should be able to add other users to their workspace, and only then will that user have access to that workspace -

When starting a workspace, the host will need to create a project for that workspace -

There will be a bulletin board style message board for updates/images that need to be communicated to all -

Each user will have their own private notes that can be taken for each project
